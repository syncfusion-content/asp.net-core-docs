# Overview of Syncfusion ASP.NET Core

The Kanban control for ASP.NET Core is an efficient way to visualize the workflow at each stage along its path to completion. The most important features available are Swim lane, filtering, and editing.

Some important features of the Kanban control are:

*   Editing - Offers card editing, inserting, and deleting using Dialog.
*   Card template - Offers to render the card based on user template.
