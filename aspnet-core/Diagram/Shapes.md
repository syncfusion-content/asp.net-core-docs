# Shapes

Diagram provides support to add different kind of nodes. They are as follows.

* Text Node
* Image Node
* HTML Node
* Native Node
* Basic Shapes
* Flow Shapes
* BPMN Shapes

## Text

Texts can be added to the Diagram as text nodes. For text nodes, the text node can be created with TextNode class . In addition, you need to define the `TextBlock` object that is used to define the `Text` to be added and to customize the appearance of that text. The following code illustrates how to create a text node.

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
        <e-nodes>
            <e-text-node name="Text" width="100" height="100" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" fill-color="transparent" border-color="transparent">
                <e-diagram-text-block text="Text Node" font-color="black" text-align="Center"></e-diagram-text-block>
            </e-text-node>          
        </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

## Image
Diagram allows to add images as image nodes. For image nodes,the **image** node can be created with ImageNode class. In addition, the `Source` property of node enables you to set the image source. The following code illustrates how an **Image** node is created.

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
        <e-nodes>
          <e-image-node name="Image" width="100" height="100" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" border-color="black" source="sample/syncfusion.png"></e-image-node>        
        </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>
    
{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img60.png)

Deploy your HTML file in the web Application and export the diagram (image node) or else the image node will not be exported in the chrome and Firefox due to security issues. Please refer to the link below.

## HTML

**HTML** elements can be embedded in the Diagram through **HTML** type node. To create a HTML node, node can be created with HtmlNode class. In addition, you need to set the id of HTML template to the `TemplateId` property of node. The following code illustrates how an **HTML** node is created.

{% highlight html %}

    <!--dependency scripts-->
    <script src="http://borismoore.github.io/jsrender/jsrender.min.js"></script>
    <!â€”define html element-->
    <script id="htmlTemplate" type="text/x-jsrender">
        <div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-top: 18px">
            <input type="button" value="Button" />
        </div>
    </script>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
        <e-nodes>
          <e-html-node name="Html" width="120" height="60" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" template-id="htmlTemplate" fill-color="darkCyan"></e-html-node>        
        </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img61.png)

N> HTML node cannot be exported to image format, like JPEG, PNG, and BMP. It is by design that while exporting, Diagram is drawn in a canvas. Further, this canvas is exported into image formats. Currently, drawing in a canvas equivalent from all possible HTML is not feasible. Hence, this limitation. 

## Native

**Diagram** provides support to embed **SVG** element into a node. To create a native node, the node can be created with NativeNode class. Also, you need to define the id of the SVG template by using the `TemplateId` property of node. The following code illustrates how a **Native node** is created.

{% highlight html %}

    <!--dependency scripts-->
    <script src="http://borismoore.github.io/jsrender/jsrender.min.js">
    </script>
    <!--define html element-->
    <script id="svgTemplate" type="text/x-jsrender">
        <g>	
            <path d="M 58.813 0 H 3.182 L 30.998 24.141 L 58.813 0 Z
            M 32.644 34.425 C 32.133 34.87 31.567 35.095 31 35.095 S
            29.867 34.87 29.353 34.425 L 1 9.826V 60 H 61 V 9.826 L
            32.644 34.425Z"></path>
        </g>
    </script>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
        <e-nodes>
            <e-native-node name="Native" width="100" height="100" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" template-id="svgTemplate">
                <e-labels>
                    <e-diagram-label text="Mail">
                        <e-offset x="0.5f" y="1.1f"></e-offset>
                    </e-diagram-label>
                </e-labels>
            </e-native-node>    
        </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>
     
{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img62.png)

N> Like HTML node, Native node also cannot be exported to image format. Fill color of native node can be overridden by the inline style or fill of the SVG element specified in the template. 

## Basic Shapes

The Basic shapes are common shapes that are used to represent the geometrical information visually. Its `Shape` property can be set with any one of the built-in shape. [Basic Shapes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/Syncfusion.JavaScript.DataVisualization.Models.Diagram.BasicShape.html#Syncfusion_JavaScript_DataVisualization_Models_Diagram_BasicShape_Shape "Basic Shapes"). 
The following code example illustrates how to create a basic shape. 

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
        <e-nodes>
          <e-basic-shape name="basic" width="100" height="70" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" border-width="2" border-color="black" corner-radius="10" shape="Rectangle"></e-basic-shape>    
        </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img1.png)


N> When the `Shape` is not set for a basic shape, it is considered a "rectangle".

## Path

Path node is a commonly used basic shape that allows visually to represent the geometrical information. To create a path node, node can be created with PathNode class and PathData property. The `PathData` property of node allows you to define the path to be drawn. The following code illustrates how a Path node is created.

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
       <e-nodes>
          <e-basic-shape name="Path" width="100" height="70" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100" shape="Path" fill-color="darkCyan"  border-color="black" border-width="2" path-data="M35.2441,25 L22.7161,49.9937 L22.7161,0.006575 L35.2441,25 z M22.7167,25 L-0.00131226,25 M35.2441,49.6337 L35.2441,0.368951 M35.2441,25 L49.9981,25">
          </e-basic-shape>
       </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img58.png)

The list of basic shapes are as follows.

## Flow Shapes

The flow shapes are used to represent the process flow. It is used for analyzing, designing, and managing for documentation process. To create a flow shape, node can be created with FlowShape class. Its `Shape` property can be set with any one of the built-in shape. [Flow Shapes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/Syncfusion.JavaScript.DataVisualization.Models.Diagram.FlowShape.html#Syncfusion_JavaScript_DataVisualization_Models_Diagram_FlowShape_Shape "Flow Shapes") and by default, it is considered as "Process". The following code example illustrates how to create a flow shape.

## BPMN Shapes

BPMN shapes are used to represent the internal business procedure in a graphical notation and enables you to communicate the procedures in a standard manner. To create a BPMN shape, node can be created with BPMNNode class and its `Shape` should be set as any one of the built-in shape. [BPMN Shapes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/Syncfusion.JavaScript.DataVisualization.Models.Diagram.BPMNNode.html#Syncfusion_JavaScript_DataVisualization_Models_Diagram_BPMNNode_Shape "BPMN Shapes"). The following code example illustrates how to create a simple business process. 

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
       <e-nodes>
         <e-bpmn-node name="Bpmn" width="100" height="100" offset-X="100" offset-Y="100"  border-color="black" border-width="2" shape="@BPMNShapes.Event" event="@BPMNEvents.End"></e-bpmn-node>
       </e-nodes>
    </ej-diagram>

{% endhighlight %}

![](Shapes_images/Shapes_img5.png)

The BPMN shapes and its types are explained as follows.

### Event 

An event is notated with a circle and it represents an event in a business process. The type of events are as follows.

* Start
* End
* Intermediate

The `Event` property of the node allows you to define the type of the event. The default value of the `Event` is "Start". The following code example illustrates how to create a BPMN Event.

{% highlight razor %}

    <ej-diagram id="diagram" width="900px" height="600px">
       <e-nodes>

### Activity

The activity is the task that is performed in a business process. It is represented by a rounded rectangle.

There are two types of activities .They are listed as follows.

* Task â€“ Occurs within a process and it is not broken down to finer level of detail.
* Subprocess â€“ Occurs within a process and it is broken down to finer level of detail.

To create a BPMN activity, you need to set the `Shape` as "Activity". You also need to set the type of the [BPMN Activity](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetmvc/Syncfusion.JavaScript.DataVisualization.Models.Diagram.BPMNNode.html#Syncfusion_JavaScript_DataVisualization_Models_Diagram_BPMNNode_Activity "BPMN Activity") by using the `Activity` property of node. By default, the type of the `Activity` is set as "Task". The following code example illustrates how to create an activity.
