# Tab

The Tab control is an interface where list of items are expanded from a single item. Each Tab panel defines its header text or header template, as well as a content template. Tab items are dynamically added and removed. Tabs can be loaded with AJAX content that is useful for building dashboards where space is limited.

## Key Features

* Collapsible header: All headers are collapsible.
* AJAX load: Load AJAX content in the Tab content panel.
* Close button: Provides a close button for each Tab item.
* Custom event for expanding header: Activate a Tab item on a single click, or bind custom events such as mouse over or mouse up to activate a Tab.
* Header orientation: Change the header position to the top or bottom of the control.
* Persist: Save the current model value to browser cookies to maintain the state.
* Height style: Adjust the content panel height.
* RTL: Tab headers and content can display right-to-left languages.
* Add Tab dynamically: New Tab items can be added and removed at run time.
* Theme: Essential ASP.NET Core controls feature 17 built-in themes, six flat themes, six with gradient effects, bootstrap theme, two high-contrast, material theme and office-365 themes and also support custom skin options to set user-defined themes.
* Keyboard navigation: You can interact with the control using the keyboard.
