# MaskEdit

The MaskEdit control provides an easy and reliable way of collecting user input and displaying standard data in a specific format. Some common uses of the MaskEdit control are IP address editors, phone number editors, and Social Security number editors.

## Key Features

* Mask: The format where the value should be entered in the text box can be set using this property.
* Input Mode: This feature allows the MaskEdit text box to act as an input text box or password text box.
* Watermark Text:The MaskEdit text box supports watermarking. A watermark is background text that appears in the text box without interfering with user text entry or the readability of the text entered. It can be used to display a ready instruction or other important information for the user. It appears automatically before the text is entered and disappears once the user begins entering text.
* Theme: Essential ASP.NET Core controls feature 17 built-in themes: 11 flat themes and 6 with gradient effects. They also support custom skin options for user-defined themes.
