## OverView

The Grid control for ASP.NET Core is an efficient display engine for tabular data. It will pull from a datasource, such as List of collections, OData web services, or DataManager, binding data fields to columns and displaying a column header to identify the field. It is a feature-rich control that provides extensive appearance customization options with support for grouped records. This Grid is very useful for generating complex grid-based reports with rich formatting. Almost all the features in JS Grid are applicable to Grid in ASP.NET Core too.

* **Data** **sources**—Bind the Grid control with a List of collections or ej.DataManager.
