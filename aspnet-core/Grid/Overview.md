# OverView

The grid control for ASP.NET Core is an efficient display engine for tabular data. It will pull from a datasource, such as List of collections, OData web services, or DataManager and binding data fields to columns and displaying a column header to identify the field. It is a feature-rich control that provides extensive appearance customization options with support for grouped records. This grid is very useful for generating complex grid-based reports with rich formatting. Almost all the features in JS grid are applicable to grid in ASP.NET Core too.
