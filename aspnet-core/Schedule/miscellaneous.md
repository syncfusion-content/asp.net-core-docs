## Time Indicator

The current system time can be depicted in a scheduler with an indication of a piece of text displaying the time over a horizontal line across today’s date (Vertical Scheduler mode). In Horizontal mode, the time indicator is displayed as a small vertical line within the header time cells (depicting current time). 

It is enabled by default in Scheduler and to hide it, `show-current-time-indicator` property needs to be set as **false** as shown below.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" width="100%" height="525px" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)" show-current-time-indicator="false">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>

{% endhighlight %}

N> When Scheduler rendered with multiple resources, multiple time indicators are displayed in Vertical mode – whereas single indicator displays for horizontal mode.

## Show/Hide All-Day Row

The All-day row cell is a single row region displayed at the top of the work cells area to hold the all-day appointments together. The Scheduler displays it by default and if it needs to be hidden, the `show-all-day-row` property can be set to **false** as shown below.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" width="100%" height="525px" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)" show-all-day-row="false">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>

{% endhighlight %}

N> The All-day row expands vertically, whenever more number of appointments are populated in one or more days.

## Show/Hide Header bar

The header bar is the top most region of the Scheduler which includes the date navigation icons and view navigation options – and also shown on the Scheduler by default. To hide the header bar, set the `show-header-bar` property to **false** as shown below.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" width="100%" height="525px" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)" show-header-bar="false">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>

{% endhighlight %}

## Show/Hide Location Field

The Location field in the default appointment window can be displayed or hidden from it using the `show-location-field` property. By default, this property is set to false. To display the location option in the appointment window, then set **show-location-field** to **true** and also bind the appropriate field to the location property within the appointmentSettings as shown below.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" width="100%" height="525px" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)" show-location-field="true">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"' location='"EventLocation"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>
