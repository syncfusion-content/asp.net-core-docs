# Responsiveness

Scheduler is provided with default **responsive** support, so that it adjust or auto-resize it’s UI content based on the window or the container size on which it is placed. 

## Auto-Resizing Scheduler

By default, setting 100% width to the Scheduler makes it adaptable to the window or its parent container, as and when the browser is resized. This will not allow the scheduler to adapt height-wise.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" width="100%" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>

{% endhighlight %}

To auto-resize the Scheduler height – set the **height** property of the Scheduler to **100%** and also set some specific height (either percentage or pixel values) to its parent container (or) to the HTML and body tag elements as shown below.

{% highlight razor %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" height="100%" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
</ej-schedule>

{% endhighlight %}

N>  When the Scheduler width is set to have **less** **than** **600px**, then the View selection options will be displayed in a **navigation** **drawer**.  

Also, whenever the Scheduler resizes - the width of the work cells adjusts automatically (if no **cell-width** property is specified with pixel values), but the height of the cells are kept to remain as same as 20px until **cell-height** property is set explicitly with some pixel values.

## Scheduler in Mobile/Tablets

The Scheduler layout adapts automatically in the mobile and tablet devices with the appropriate UI changes, as the `is-responsive` property is set to **true** by default. In case, if the user wants to display the normal scheduler in mobile devices without any adaptive enhancements, then the `is-responsive` property can be set to false.

Some of the default changes done for adaptive Scheduler to render in mobile devices are as follows,

* Animation effect introduced between view/date navigation.
* Cell Height increased
* The header date display changes (displayed next to the navigation icons).
* View options displayed in Navigation drawer
* Time cell width decreased
* Quick window display blocked on cell/appointment single click.
* Appointment resizing action blocked.
* Multiple cell selection blocked.
* Delete appointment option made available within the appointment window.
* Week header display in month view hidden.
* With Multiple resources - only one resource is viewable initially on the screen and to further look onto other resources, user need to swipe the screen.

N> To make the Scheduler control to react as responsive in mobile/tablet devices, it is necessary to refer the additional [ej.responsive.css](http://cdn.syncfusion.com/{{ site.releaseversion }}/js/web/responsive-css/ej.responsive.css) file in the application.

The following code snippet depicts the Scheduler code with responsive set to true.

{% highlight html %}

@using MyProject.Models; // Here MyProject defines your project name to access the model class
@{
    <!-- Datasource for Appointments -->
    List<ScheduleFields> Appoint = new List<ScheduleFields>();
    Appoint.Add(new ScheduleFields { Id = "1", Subject = "Meeting", StartTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 10, 00, 00), EndTime = new DateTime(2015, 11, 10, 11, 00, 00), Description = "", AllDay = false, Recurrence = false, RecurrenceRule = "" });
}

<ej-schedule id="Schedule1" current-date="new DateTime(2015, 11, 8)" is-responsive="true">
    <e-appointment-settings datasource="Appoint" id="Id" subject='"Subject"' start-time='"StartTime"' end-time='"EndTime"' description='"Description"' all-day='"AllDay"' recurrence='"Recurrence"' recurrence-rule='"RecurrenceRule"'>
    </e-appointment-settings>
