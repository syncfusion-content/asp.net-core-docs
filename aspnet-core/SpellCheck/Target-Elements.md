# Supported Target Elements

The SpellCheck control has support for spell checking the HTML element’s texts such as div, span, textarea, input, address, article and IFrame elements.

## Multiple Target

The SpellCheck control has support for multiple target HTML element’s texts spelling and correct its error words. This can be achieved by passing the target HTML elements “id” values or “CSS Class Name” or combination of both id and class names to the property **ControlsToValidate**.

The following code example describes the above behavior.

{% highlight cshtml %}

<div id="control1">
    London, one of the most popular touist destinations in the world for a reason. A cultural and hisorical hub, London has an excellent public transportation system that allows visitors to see all the fantatic sights without spending a ton of money on a rental car. London contains four World Heritage Sites.

</ej-spell-check>

{% endhighlight %}

You need to pass the target HTML element’s id value or CSS class name or combination of the id value and class name with comma separator. Passing the class name followed by (.) character and passing the id value followed by the (#) character.

The following code example describes the spell checking of HTML element’s.

{% highlight cshtml %}

<div id="control1">
    London, one of the most popular touist destinations in the world for a reason. A cultural and hisorical hub, London has an excellent public transportation system that allows visitors to see all the fantatic sights without spending a ton of money on a rental car.

</span>
<ej-spell-check id="SpellCheck" controls-to-validate="#control1,#control2,#control3">
    <e-dictionary-settings custom-dictionary-url="http://js.syncfusion.com/ejServices/api/SpellCheck/AddToDictionary" dictionary-url="http://js.syncfusion.com/ejServices/api/SpellCheck/CheckWords">
    </e-dictionary-settings>               
</ej-spell-check>
<ej-button id="CheckButton" width="200px" height="25px" text="Spell check using dialog" click="checkErrors" />

<script type="text/javascript">
    function checkErrors() {
        var spellObj = $("#SpellCheck").data("ejSpellCheck");
        spellObj.showInDialog();
    }
</script>

{% endhighlight %}

The SpellCheck component iterates through the target elements which specified in the “ControlsToValidate” property, and process the element’s content one by one in the order of CSS elements, and id specified elements.

**IFrame Element**

The below code example shows the way to spell check the IFrame target element text.

{% highlight cshtml %}

<iframe id="Spell" ClientIDMode="Static" src="iframesource.html" height="300" width="800"></iframe>
<ej-spell-check id="SpellCheck" controls-to-validate="#control1,#control2,#control3">
    <e-dictionary-settings custom-dictionary-url="http://js.syncfusion.com/ejServices/api/SpellCheck/AddToDictionary" dictionary-url="http://js.syncfusion.com/ejServices/api/SpellCheck/CheckWords">
    </e-dictionary-settings>               
</ej-spell-check>
<ej-button id="CheckButton" width="200px" height="25px" text="Spell check using dialog" click="checkErrors" />

<script type="text/javascript">
    function checkErrors() {
        var spellObj = $("#SpellCheck").data("ejSpellCheck");
        spellObj.showInDialog();
    }
</script>

{% endhighlight %}

N> If you want to spell check the IFrame’s element content, you need to pass the IFrame element alone in **ControlsToValidate** property. You could not perform the spell check with the combination of other elements with IFrame element.
