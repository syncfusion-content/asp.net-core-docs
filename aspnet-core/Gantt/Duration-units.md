# Duration Units

In Gantt, the tasksâ€™ duration value can be measured by the following duration units, 

* Day
* Hour
* Minute

Each task in the project can be defined with different duration units and the duration unit of a task can be defined by the following ways,

1. Using `duration-unit-mapping` property, to map the duration unit data source field.
2. Defining the duration unit value along with the duration field in the data source.

## Mapping the Duration Unit field


The below code snippet explains the mapping of duration unit data source field to the Gantt control using the `duration-unit-mapping` property.

{% highlight c# %}
List<DefaultData> list = new List<DefaultData>();
    list.Add(new DefaultData()
        {
            Id = 1,
            Name = "Design",
            StartDate = "02/10/2014",
            EndDate = "02/14/2014",
            Duration = 5,
            PercentDone = 60,
            DurationUnit = "day"
            Children = (new List<DefaultData>()
            //..
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cshtml %}
<ej-gantt id="ganttSample" datasource="ViewBag.datasource"
    duration-mapping="Duration"
    duration-unit-mapping="DurationUnit">
</ejGantt> 
{% endhighlight %}

N> 1. The default value of the `duration-unit` property is `Day`.

## Defining duration unit along with duration field

Duration units for the tasks can also be defined along with the duration values, the below code snippet explains the duration unit for a task along with duration value,

{% highlight c# %}
List<DefaultData> list = new List<DefaultData>();
    list.Add(new DefaultData()
        {
            Id = 1,
            Name = "Design",
            StartDate = "02/10/2014",
            EndDate = "02/14/2014",
            Duration = "5days",
            PercentDone = 60,
            Children = (new List<DefaultData>()
            //..
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cshtml %}
<ej-gantt id="ganttSample" datasource="ViewBag.datasource"
    duration-mapping="Duration">
</ejGantt> 
{% endhighlight %}

The below screen shot shows different duration unit support in Gantt control.

N> 1. The edit type of the duration column in Gantt is string, to support editing the duration field along with duration units.

## Localizing the duration unit


We can localize the duration unit texts like below,

{% highlight javascript %}

ej.Gantt.Locale["en-US"] = {
    //...
    durationUnitTexts: {
        days: "days",
        hours: "hours",
        minutes: "minutes",
        day: "day",
        hour: "hour",
        minute: "minute"
    },
    durationUnitEditText: {
        minute: ["m", "min", "minute", "minutes"],
        hour: ["h", "hr", "hour", "hours"],
        day: ["d", "dy", "day", "days"]
    }
};

{% endhighlight %}

N> **durationUnitTexts** property is used to display the unit of duration in columns and taskbar tooltips.
N> **durationUnitEditText** property is used to save the edited duration unit value on editing action.
