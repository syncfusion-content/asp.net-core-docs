# TimePicker

The Essential ASP.NET Core TimePicker control allows users to select a time value. The available times can be restricted to a range by setting minimum and maximum time values. The TimePicker sets the time as a mask to prevent users from entering invalid values. 

## Key Features

* Time format: Supports all valid time formats.
* Localization: Supports localization with different cultures.
* Picker and editor: Allows users to pick or edit the time.
* Persist: Supports state maintenance when refreshing the page.
* RTL: Supports right-to-left alignment in the TimePicker control.
* Themes: The TimePicker control features 12 built-in themes (six flat and six with gradient effects) and also supports custom skin options for user-defined themes.
