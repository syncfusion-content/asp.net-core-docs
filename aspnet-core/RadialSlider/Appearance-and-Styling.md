# Appearance and Styling

You can customize RadialSlider control style and appearance by using available themes or cssClass property.

## Theme

In order to apply styles to the RadialSlider control, refer to 2 files namely, ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css. When you refer ej.web.all.min.css file, it is not necessary to include the files ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css in your project, as ej.web.all.min.css is the combination of these two. 

By default, there are 13 theme support available for RadialSlider component, namely:

* flat-azure
* flat-azure-dark
* fat-lime
* flat-lime-dark
* flat-saffron
* flat-saffron-dark
* gradient-azure
* gradient-azure-dark
* gradient-lime
* gradient-lime-dark
* gradient-saffron
* gradient-saffron-dark
* bootstrap

## CssClass

**RadialSlider** control also allows you to customize its appearance using user-defined CSS. To apply custom themes you can use **CssClass** property, which sets the root class for **RadialSlider** theme.

Using this **css-class** you can override the existing styles under the theme style sheet. In the following example, the value of **CssClass** property is set as “**Purple-dark**”. **Purple-dark** is added as root class to **RadialSlider** control at the runtime. From this root class you can customize the **RadialSlider** appearance.

Add the following code example to the corresponding CSHTML page to render the RadialSlider with the customized style.

{% highlight CSHTML %}

    <ej-radial-slider id="slider" css-class="Purple-darks" />

{% endhighlight %}

Using below style sheet,exiting theme style sheet file has been over-ridden using root class “**Purple-dark**”. 

Add the following code in your style section.

{% highlight css %}
        
	  .Purple-dark{
		    background-color:pink;
		}

{% endhighlight %}

The following screenshot illustrates the output of the above code.
