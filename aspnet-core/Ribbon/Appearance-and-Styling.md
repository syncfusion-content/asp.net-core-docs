# Appearance and Styling

## Themes

Ribbon control’s style and appearance are controlled based on CSS classes and it has support of 12 default themes. You can check List of themes available for JavaScript’s control which is mentioned in [`this`](http://help.syncfusion.com/js/theming-in-essential-javascript-components) page.

To apply styles refer to two files namely

*	ej.widgets.core.min.css 
*	ej.theme.min.css

When the file `ej.widgets.all.min.css/ej.web.all.min.css` is referred, it is not necessary to include the files `ej.widgets.core.min.css` and `ej.theme.min.css` in your project as `ej.widgets.all.min.css` is the combination of these two files.
