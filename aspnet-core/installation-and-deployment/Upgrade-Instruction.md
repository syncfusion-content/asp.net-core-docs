## Upgrade from one version to another version 

You can upgrade to the latest version by downloading and installing the platforms you require from [this](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version) link. After upgrading to the latest version, instead of upgrading your projects manually, you can use the Syncfusion Project Migration for migrating your projects.

## Upgrade from major release to service pack release

Syncfusion provides a new Volume release once in every three months which has exciting new features. For that Volume release, there may be one or two Service Pack releases. The issues in the Volume release will be addressed in the Service Pack releases. You can download and install the latest Service Pack setup [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/latest-version). 


It is not required to install the Volume release setup before installing the Service Pack release setup. As Volume and Service Packs releases works independently, you can directly install the latest Service Pack setup which contains major issue fixes.
